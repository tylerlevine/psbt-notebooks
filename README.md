# PSBT Notebooks

Experiments with Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs).

Each notebook walks through a lesson on how PSBTs are used.

The plan is to have notebooks covering:
* Basic Setup
* Creating your first PSBT
* Multisig using PSBTs
* Coinjoins using PSBTs
* PSBTs and hardware wallets
